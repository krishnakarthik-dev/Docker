# **Virtual machines**
* In Virtual machines, we have our host operating system, Windows or macOS or Linux and then on top of that, we install the virtual machine.<br>
* So a computer inside of our computer.<br>
* It has it own OS which runs inside the virtual machine(eg: linux).<br>
* can create multiple virtual host for multiple project with different configurations and package versions.<br>

## **problems of virtual machines**
* virtual machine is like a stand alone computer on top of our machine which results in wastage of spaces and reasources when we have more one Virtual machines.<br>
* slow perfomance and long boot time.<br>
* Deployment is hard.<br>
* Eat more disk space.<br>

# **How containers solve this problem of virtual machines**
* By utilizing built-in container support by OS or emulated container support, something Docker will take care about that this works.<br>
* with help of a tool called Docker engine.<br>
* With Docker engine we can spim up containers.<br>
* small OS layer inside the container will br much small than present in our Host machine.<br>
* we can configure and describe containers settings and enviournment into a configuration file which make deployment easier.<br>

# **Advantage of containers over virtual machines**
* They have a low impact on our operating system and machine.<br>
* very fast.<br>
* minimal disk space.<br>
* sharing and distribution is easy.<br>
* encapsulated apps and envirourments.<br>
